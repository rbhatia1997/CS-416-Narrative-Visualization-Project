    <h1>Scene 2: Safety Records from 1985-1999</h1>
    <p>
      Airline crashes are a tragic event and sometimes the natural response when
      hearing about one is to avoid flying that particular airline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same reaction may occur when a news story about an airline
      experiencing delays or an on-flight incident occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This visualization serves to illuminate whether there is a correlation
      between airlines and flight incidents and fatalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to go about exploring this potential correlation is through
      exploring two 30-year periods using the Aviation Safety Network's
      database. <br />
      If the correlation is persistent between these two periods, we could
      possibly conclude that specific airlines may be prone to
      crashes/incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the module below, you can explore the incidents, fatal accidents, and
      fatalities for Airlines between 1985 - 1999. <br />
      I've also provided some notable airlines in the table below to highlight
      some airlines with relatively high incidents, accidents, and fatalities.
    </p>

    <!-- Dropdown menu for airlines -->
    <select id="airlineSelect">
      <option value="" selected disabled>Select an airline</option>
      <!-- Add options for each airline in the dataset -->
      <!-- For example: <option value="Aer Lingus">Aer Lingus</option> -->
    </select>
    <!-- Bar chart for Scene 2 will be added here -->

    <p>
      The higher an airline's "Rank", the closer it is to having the highest
      incident, fatality, or fatal accident number.
