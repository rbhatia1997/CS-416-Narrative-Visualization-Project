      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        When we observe the data, we notice that the number of fatalities isn't
        very consistent from the first half of the data to the next.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avianca (Colombia National Airlines) had major crashes from 1983 to 1990
        but no fatal accidents since 1990 or any incidents since 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kenya Airways had two major accidents since the 2000s, but prior to that
        had no fatalities until 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taiwan's China Airlines have had issues in both time periods, but it and
        one other airlines are the only ones that maintain that persistence and
        are exceptions. <br />We notice that there
        <b
          >isn't a direct correlation in the rate of fatalities from one period
          to the next</b
        >, which is further shown via the regression line.

      <h2>Incidents (1985-1999 vs. 2000-2014)</h2>
      <p>Hover over each data point to see specific numeric comparison.</p>
      <svg id="incidentsScatterplot" width="800" height="500"></svg>
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Accidents that produce a massive number of fatalities are rare; fatal
        accidents represent only 1/4 of all incidents in the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thought here is that incidents show the potential hazard of flying a
        certain airlines. Additionally, incidents can still reflect non-fatal
        injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this data, Delta Airlines had a a persistently high rate of
        incidents. Russia's Aeroflot had a very high rate of reported incidents
        (related to hijackings during the breakup of the Soviet Union). In
        recent years, the incident rate is closer to average. These airlines are
        some notable outliers in the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the data, there is a slight correlation between time periods for
        incidents. We can see that some airlines are slightly safer to fly than
        others.
        <br />If anything, an
        <b>
          airline's rate of dangerous incidents is a better indicator of hazard
          than fatalities.</b
